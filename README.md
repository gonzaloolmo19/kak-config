# Kakoune Config
This my kakoune config. 

# Installation
You need kakoune installed and just clone this repo to ~/.config/kak/

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/gonzaloolmo19/kak-config.git ~/.config/kak
```

After this, run kakoune and type the command :plug-install several times until all plugins are correctly installed.
